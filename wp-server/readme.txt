Show average server load and uptime of your linux server on top in admin panel

== Description ==
Show average server load and uptime of your linux server on top in admin panel. It contains three values, first one is the load average for last 15 minutes, second one is for 5 minutes, third one is for last 1 minute.

Now you can easily monitor your server load in real time whenever you want without installing any script or moving out of your wordpress admin panel.

Options include turn off, on or legacy mode.

It shows:

    3 averages for server load
    server uptime in days and hours
